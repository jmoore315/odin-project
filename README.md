<h3>Test first Ruby project</h3>
<p>Solutions for some of the <a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">Test First Ruby Project</a> exercises.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ruby Building Blocks</h3>
<p>A few simple Ruby programs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Caesar Cypher: Ciphers an input string using a simple character shift encryption.</li>
	<li>Stock Picker: Given an array of integers representing stock prices, finds the best days to buy and sell the stocks.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Procs and Blocks</h3>
<p>A couple more "advanced" Ruby programs (still pretty simple) with RSpec tests</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bubble Sort with comparator: Sorts an array using bubble sort with a comparator passed as a block</li>
	<li>Enumerable methods: Writing some of the more common enumerable methods (each, any?, map, etc) from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ruby OOP Games</h3>
<p>Two classic games for Terminal written in Ruby:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tic Tac Toe: Nothing unusual here.</li>
	<li>Mastermind: Guess the computer's code or try to stump the computer with your own code. Complete with AI and a full RSpec test suite.</li>
</ul>
<h3>File I/O Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Event Manager: a Ruby script to read data from a CSV file and generate personalized letters. Uses the Ruby 'sunlight' gem to make API calls to the Congressional Sunlight API.</li>

</ul>
